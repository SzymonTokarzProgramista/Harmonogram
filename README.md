# Schedule

This project uses a Genetic Algorithm to generate the most optimal class schedule for students, taking into account multiple constraints such as available classrooms, instructors' schedules, and preferred time slots.

The algorithm simulates the process of natural selection by evolving potential timetables over several generations. It selects and combines the best solutions based on criteria like room availability, instructor time preferences, and avoiding conflicts, gradually improving the quality of the schedule.

The goal is to create an efficient, conflict-free timetable that satisfies both organizational and individual requirements, reducing manual planning effort and increasing overall scheduling flexibility.
